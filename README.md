## General Information
- Borrowers can easily access lower interest rate loans through a fast online interface.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Users with short terms loans tend to default less and are hence better suited to be approved for a loan.
- The lower the grade(with A being higher and G being lower) the more the default percentage.
- Counter Intuitively, unverified users have lower default percentages compared to rest.
- Users taking loan for small business tend to have an extremely high default percentage(~27%) while users taking loan for car, credit card, wedding and major purchases tend to perform better.
- Loans taken from eastern region of USA(MA, PA, VA, ETC...) tend to perform better in terms of default.
- Default rates tend to get higher moving towards the festive month of Christmas(May to December) and are less for the intial part of the year(January to April).
- Users with lower loan amount tend to default less than users with higher loan amount. Giving loans of higher amounts is riskier.
- Users with lower interest rates tend to perform significantly better and default way less than users with higher interest rates.
- Employment length has no significant impact on the default rates.
- Users with higher annual income perform way better than users with low income.
- Users with higher debt to income ratio tend to default more than users with less debit to income ratio.
